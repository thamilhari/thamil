Please provide the following information:

    A description of the dataset you're working with, including the column names and their meanings.
    The programming language and libraries you plan to use for this analysis (e.g., Python with pandas, scikit-learn, etc.).
    Any specific data preprocessing steps you want to perform, such as cleaning, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.
    Details about the EDA you'd like to conduct, such as specific visualizations or statistics you want to generate.
    The type of predictive model you want to build (e.g., logistic regression, random forest, etc.).
    Any specific metrics or evaluation criteria you want to use for the predictive model.

Once I have this information, I can help you compile the code for your analysis.

Prerequisites

Before running the ROC Company Analysis tool, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed on your system:

    Python 3.x: Download Python
    pip: The Python package manager

Installation

    Clone this repository to your local machine:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/thamilhari/roc-company-analysis.git
cd roc-company-analysis

Install the required Python packages using pip:

bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

The ROC Company Analysis tool allows you to analyze ROC ratios for a list of companies. Here are the basic steps to use it:

    Prepare a CSV file with the financial data of the companies you want to analyze. The CSV file should include at least the following columns:
        Company Name
        Net Income
        Total Assets
        Total Liabilities
        Shareholders' Equity

    Here is an example CSV file format:

    css

Company Name,Net Income,Total Assets,Total Liabilities,Shareholders' Equity
Company A,1000000,5000000,3000000,2000000
Company B,800000,4000000,2500000,1500000

Run the ROC analysis tool with the following command:

bash

    python roc_analysis.py -i input.csv -o output.csv

    Replace input.csv with the path to your input CSV file and output.csv with the desired output file name. The tool will calculate ROC ratios for each company and save the results in the output CSV file.

Examples

Here are some examples of how to use the ROC Company Analysis tool:

    Basic usage:

    bash

python roc_analysis.py -i input.csv -o output.csv

Analyze a different financial metric (e.g., EBIT instead of Net Income):

bash

python roc_analysis.py -i input.csv -o output.csv -m EBIT

Adjust the tax rate for ROC calculation:

bash

    python roc_analysis.py -i input.csv -o output.csv -t 0.25
